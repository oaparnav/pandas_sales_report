# Sales Report Generation

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to generate a comprehensive sales report using sales data stored in a CSV file. The project aims to achieve the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Retrieve sales data from a CSV file and load it into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean the data by removing any missing values or irrelevant columns.
3. **Data Storage**: Store the cleaned data in a SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module.
4. **Data Analysis**: Perform data analysis on the sales data to generate insights and metrics such as total sales per product, total sales per year, average prices per product, and sales distribution by quantity.
5. **Data Visualization**: Utilize the `matplotlib` library to create visualizations such as line charts for each metric, showcasing the sales trends and patterns.
6. **Report Generation**: Generate a comprehensive sales report in PDF format, containing the visualizations and key findings.
7. **Data Persistence**: Store the processed metrics and insights into separate database tables for future reference and analysis.

By completing these steps, the project provides valuable insights into the sales performance, trends, and distribution, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for the business.
