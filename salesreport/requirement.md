# Task: Analyzing Sales Data and Creating a Sales Report

You have been given a dataset containing sales data for a company. The dataset is in CSV format and includes information such as the product name, quantity sold, price, and date of sale. Your task is to analyze the sales data using Pandas and create a sales report with visualizations.

## Data Manipulation:

- Load the sales data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Explore the data to understand its structure and identify any missing values or inconsistencies.
- Clean the data by handling missing values and converting data types if necessary.
- Perform any additional data preprocessing steps required for analysis.

## Analysis and Visualization:

- Calculate the total sales for each product and create a bar chart to visualize the top-selling products.
- Determine the monthly sales revenue and create a line plot to show the revenue trend over time.
- Calculate the average price per product category and create a bar chart to compare the categories.
- Analyze the sales distribution and create a histogram to visualize the distribution of sale quantities.
- Generate any additional charts or visualizations that you find relevant for the sales analysis.

## Database Connection:

- Connect to a local SQLite database using Pandas.
- Create a new table in the database to store the cleaned sales data.
- Insert the cleaned sales data from the DataFrame into the database table.

## File Uploading:

- Provide functionality to upload a new sales data file from the user.
- Process the uploaded file by cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Append the processed data to the existing sales data in the SQLite database.

## Sales Report:

- Generate a summary report that includes key metrics such as total sales, average price, and monthly revenue.
- Save the report to a PDF file, including the visualizations created during the analysis.

Remember to break down the task into smaller steps and test your code at each stage to ensure accuracy. Feel free to explore additional functionalities and customize the analysis and report according to your preferences.

Good luck with your project!
